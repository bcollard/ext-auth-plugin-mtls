- type: BREAKING_CHANGE
  description: >
    From now, fetching the go dependencies is also done in the docker container where we also build the plugin.
    This prevents package incompatibilities when the version of go in the local machine is different than the one that we use in the docker file.

  description: >
    The `resolve-deps` script will merge your plugin dependencies with the gloo dependencies and verify if it's compatible with the targeted GlooE version.
    If there are mismatched dependencies, use the information of outputted mismatched content to update your `go.mod` file.
    This means replacing existing entries and adding missing entries.
    Once you have updated the `go.mod` file, run the `resolve-deps` target again. You might need to do this a few times
    before all the dependencies match.
    The `go.mod` in this repo is known to work from GlooE `1.3.1` and higher
